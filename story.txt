Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between green hills and sparkling rivers, there lived a curious young girl named Lina. Unlike other children, Lina didn't enjoy toys or games—she loved questions. She would ask about everything: why the sky changed colors, where the birds went in winter, and how bread rose in the oven.

One day, while walking near the edge of the forest, Lina found a small, worn book lying under a tree. The book had no title, but when she opened it, glowing words appeared: "To those who seek, answers will come." From that moment on, Lina discovered that the book would reveal answers to any question she wrote in its pages—but only once per day.

Over time, she learned the book didn’t give straight facts, but riddles and poems that led her to seek out the truth herself. She became the village’s greatest problem-solver—not because she had all the answers, but because she learned how to find them.

Years later, when Lina had grown old and wise, the book disappeared—just as mysteriously as it had arrived. But by then, Lina had passed on her love of questions to the village children, who would carry on the magic of curiosity for generations to come.
